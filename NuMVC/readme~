NuMVC is a solver for the minimum vertex cover problem.

1. The input format
The input graph is asked to be in DIMACS ascii format for undirected graphs.

A small exmple is given as follow:

c nodes: 4, edges: 3
c the lines begin with a 'c' are comment lines and are not considered by the solvers.
c the graph data begin with a 'p' line that in the format as: p edge <number of nodes> <number of edges>,
c followed by all 'e' lines.
p edge 4 3
e 1 2
e 1 3
e 2 4

2. Usage
NuMVC, also named tsewf as it uses two strategies TSE (two stage exchange) and WF (weightting with forgetting), is a stochastic local search and needs a random seed.

The command to run NuMVC is: ./tsewf <filename> <optimal size of vc> <random seed>  <cutoff time (s)>. 

NuMVC terminates when finding a vertex cover of the provided <optimal size of vc>, or reaching the cutoff time.
Specially, if you want to terminate the solver only when reaching the cutoff time, set optimal_size to 0.
